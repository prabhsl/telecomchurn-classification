Telecom churn classification using scikit-learn library. This notebook uses various models to test which one fits our dataset the best. Data visualization is included in the notebook and the in depth data visualization for insights is provided in the Autoviz folder (Github was unable to display them properly in the notebook). The trained models are then used for inference on unseen data to find out which is the best performing model out of the models we trained and tuned.
